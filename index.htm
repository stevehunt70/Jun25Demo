    <font family="verdana" size="4">
        Having started my life as an Accountant for a Mercedes and Porsche car company in Brighton, I progressed into the IT world.<br>
        I became a fully qualified IT technician whilst working in the alternative energy sector for Vestas Wind Systems, a Danish based company.<br>
        After being made redundant in 2012, I was asked to set up a UK office for a French company to sell their reporting software in the UK market, Inside XL.
